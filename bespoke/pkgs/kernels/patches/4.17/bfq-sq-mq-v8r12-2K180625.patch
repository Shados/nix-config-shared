+	 * from destroying both the original blkg and all objects
+	 * directly or indirectly referred by the copy of the
+	 * blkg.
+	 *
+	 * On the bright side, destroy operations on a blkg invoke, as

+	 * are holding bfqd->lock. A blkg_lookup performed with
+	 * bfqd->lock held then returns a fully consistent blkg, which
+	 * remains consistent until this lock is held.
+	 *
+	 * Thanks to the last fact, and to the fact that: (1) bfqg has
+	 * been obtained through a blkg_lookup in the above
+	 * assignment, and (2) bfqd->lock is being held, here we can
+	 * safely use the policy data for the involved blkg (i.e., the

+	 *

+	 * blkg data we may need for this bic, and for its associated
+	 * bfq_queue. As of now, we need to cache only the path of the
+	 * blkg, which is used in the bfq_log_* functions.
+	 *
+	 * Finally, note that bfqg itself needs to be protected from
+	 * destruction on the blkg_free of the original blkg (which

+ * Licensed under the GPL-2 as detailed in the accompanying COPYING.BFQ
+ * file.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * In particular, BFQ schedules I/O so as to achieve the latter goal--
+ * low latency for interactive and soft real-time applications--if the
+ * low_latency parameter is set (default configuration). To this
+ * purpose, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether the I/O requests in
+ * a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft real-time
+ * application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is said to be
+ * interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ privileges the
+ * service of the queue, over that of non-interactive and
+ * non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed, mainly,
+ * by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we call just
+ * weight-raising periods the time periods during which a queue is
+ * privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
+ *
+ * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
+ * detail in the comments on the function
+ * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
+ * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
+ * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
+ * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
+ * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
+ * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
+ * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
+ *
+ * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
+ * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
+ * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
+ * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
+ * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
+ * weight-raising for interactive queues.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial,
+ * more theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader
+ * can find in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as
+ * well as formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the
+ * properties.  With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these
+ * papers, this implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the
+ * one that guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications,
+ * and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * When configured for computing the duration of the weight-raising

+ * duration = (ref_rate / r) * ref_wr_duration,
+ * where r is the peak rate of the device, and ref_rate and
+ * ref_wr_duration are two reference parameters.  In particular,
+ * ref_rate is the peak rate of the reference storage device (see
+ * below), and ref_wr_duration is about the maximum time needed, with
+ * BFQ and while reading two files in parallel, to load typical large
+ * applications on the reference device (see the comments on
+ * max_service_from_wr below, for more details on how ref_wr_duration
+ * is obtained).  In practice, the slower/faster the device at hand
+ * is, the more/less it takes to load applications with respect to the
+ * reference device.  Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants
+ * weight raising to interactive applications.
+ *
+ * BFQ uses two different reference pairs (ref_rate, ref_wr_duration),
+ * depending on whether the device is rotational or non-rotational.
+ *
+ * In the following definitions, ref_rate[0] and ref_wr_duration[0]
+ * are the reference values for a rotational device, whereas
+ * ref_rate[1] and ref_wr_duration[1] are the reference values for a
+ * non-rotational device. The reference rates are not the actual peak
+ * rates of the devices used as a reference, but slightly lower
+ * values. The reason for using slightly lower values is that the
+ * peak-rate estimator tends to yield slightly lower values than the
+ * actual peak rate (it can yield the actual peak rate only if there
+ * is only one process doing I/O, and the process does sequential
+ * I/O).
+ *
+ * The reference peak rates are measured in sectors/usec, left-shifted
+ * by BFQ_RATE_SHIFT.

+ * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
+ * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
+ * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transferred.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
+ * described at the beginning of these comments.

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created

+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q

+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from

+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
+ * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
+ * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
+ * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
+ * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
+ * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
+ * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
+ * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
+ * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
+ * finishes.
+ *
+ * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
+ * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
+ * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
+ * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
+ * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
+ * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
+ * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
+ * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
+ * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
+ * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
+ * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
+ * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
+ * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
+ * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
+ *
+ * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
+ * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

+	 * weight-raised queues.
+	 *
+	 * When the request pool is saturated (e.g., in the presence
+	 * of write hogs), if the processes associated with
+	 * non-weight-raised queues ask for requests at a lower rate,
+	 * then processes associated with weight-raised queues have a

+	 * they have a higher probability to actually get a fraction

+	 * which enqueue several requests in advance, and further
+	 * reorder internally-queued requests.

+	 * behavior causes bfqq, and hence any sync non-weight-raised
+	 * queue, to get a lower number of requests served, and thus
+	 * to ask for a lower number of requests from the request
+	 * pool, before the busy weight-raised queues get served
+	 * again. This often mitigates starvation problems in the
+	 * presence of heavy write workloads and NCQ, thereby
+	 * guaranteeing a higher application and system responsiveness
+	 * in these hostile scenarios.

+	 * There is then a case where idling must be performed not
+	 * for throughput concerns, but to preserve service
+	 * guarantees.
+	 *
+	 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+	 * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+	 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+	 * to let requests be served in the desired order until all

+ * that will be served next, if 1) no changes in the schedule occurs
+ * before the current in-service entity is expired, 2) the in-service
+ * queue becomes idle when it expires, and 3) if the entity pointed by
+ * in_service_entity is not a queue, then the in-service child entity
+ * of the entity pointed by in_service_entity becomes idle on

+ * BFQ is a proportional-share I/O scheduler, with some extra
+ * low-latency capabilities. BFQ also supports full hierarchical
+ * scheduling through cgroups. Next paragraphs provide an introduction
+ * on BFQ inner workings. Details on BFQ benefits and usage can be
+ * found in Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt.
+ *
+ * BFQ is a proportional-share storage-I/O scheduling algorithm based
+ * on the slice-by-slice service scheme of CFQ. But BFQ assigns
+ * budgets, measured in number of sectors, to processes instead of
+ * time slices. The device is not granted to the in-service process
+ * for a given time slice, but until it has exhausted its assigned
+ * budget. This change from the time to the service domain enables BFQ
+ * to distribute the device throughput among processes as desired,
+ * without any distortion due to throughput fluctuations, or to device
+ * internal queueing. BFQ uses an ad hoc internal scheduler, called
+ * B-WF2Q+, to schedule processes according to their budgets. More
+ * precisely, BFQ schedules queues associated with processes. Thanks to
+ * the accurate policy of B-WF2Q+, BFQ can afford to assign high
+ * budgets to I/O-bound processes issuing sequential requests (to
+ * boost the throughput), and yet guarantee a low latency to
+ * interactive and soft real-time applications.
+ *
+ * In particular, BFQ schedules I/O so as to achieve the latter goal--
+ * low latency for interactive and soft real-time applications--if the
+ * low_latency parameter is set (default configuration). To this
+ * purpose, BFQ constantly tries to detect whether the I/O requests in
+ * a bfq_queue come from an interactive or a soft real-time
+ * application. For brevity, in these cases, the queue is said to be
+ * interactive or soft real-time. In both cases, BFQ privileges the
+ * service of the queue, over that of non-interactive and
+ * non-soft-real-time queues. This privileging is performed, mainly,
+ * by raising the weight of the queue. So, for brevity, we call just
+ * weight-raising periods the time periods during which a queue is
+ * privileged, because deemed interactive or soft real-time.
+ *
+ * The detection of soft real-time queues/applications is described in
+ * detail in the comments on the function
+ * bfq_bfqq_softrt_next_start. On the other hand, the detection of an
+ * interactive queue works as follows: a queue is deemed interactive
+ * if it is constantly non empty only for a limited time interval,
+ * after which it does become empty. The queue may be deemed
+ * interactive again (for a limited time), if it restarts being
+ * constantly non empty, provided that this happens only after the
+ * queue has remained empty for a given minimum idle time.
+ *
+ * By default, BFQ computes automatically the above maximum time
+ * interval, i.e., the time interval after which a constantly
+ * non-empty queue stops being deemed interactive. Since a queue is
+ * weight-raised while it is deemed interactive, this maximum time
+ * interval happens to coincide with the (maximum) duration of the
+ * weight-raising for interactive queues.
+ *
+ * NOTE: if the main or only goal, with a given device, is to achieve
+ * the maximum-possible throughput at all times, then do switch off
+ * all low-latency heuristics for that device, by setting low_latency
+ * to 0.
+ *
+ * BFQ is described in [1], where also a reference to the initial,
+ * more theoretical paper on BFQ can be found. The interested reader
+ * can find in the latter paper full details on the main algorithm, as
+ * well as formulas of the guarantees and formal proofs of all the
+ * properties.  With respect to the version of BFQ presented in these
+ * papers, this implementation adds a few more heuristics, such as the
+ * one that guarantees a low latency to soft real-time applications,
+ * and a hierarchical extension based on H-WF2Q+.
+ *
+ * B-WF2Q+ is based on WF2Q+, that is described in [2], together with
+ * H-WF2Q+, while the augmented tree used to implement B-WF2Q+ with O(log N)
+ * complexity derives from the one introduced with EEVDF in [3].

+ * where r is the peak rate of the device, and ref_rate and

+ *

+ *
+ * In the following definitions, ref_rate[0] and ref_wr_duration[0]
+ * are the reference values for a rotational device, whereas

+ * rates of the devices used as a reference, but slightly lower
+ * values. The reason for using slightly lower values is that the
+ * peak-rate estimator tends to yield slightly lower values than the
+ * actual peak rate (it can yield the actual peak rate only if there
+ * is only one process doing I/O, and the process does sequential
+ * I/O).

+ * BFQ uses the above-detailed, time-based weight-raising mechanism to
+ * privilege interactive tasks. This mechanism is vulnerable to the
+ * following false positives: I/O-bound applications that will go on
+ * doing I/O for much longer than the duration of weight
+ * raising. These applications have basically no benefit from being
+ * weight-raised at the beginning of their I/O. On the opposite end,
+ * while being weight-raised, these applications
+ * a) unjustly steal throughput to applications that may actually need
+ * low latency;
+ * b) make BFQ uselessly perform device idling; device idling results
+ * in loss of device throughput with most flash-based storage, and may
+ * increase latencies when used purposelessly.
+ *
+ * BFQ tries to reduce these problems, by adopting the following
+ * countermeasure. To introduce this countermeasure, we need first to
+ * finish explaining how the duration of weight-raising for
+ * interactive tasks is computed.
+ *
+ * For a bfq_queue deemed as interactive, the duration of weight
+ * raising is dynamically adjusted, as a function of the estimated
+ * peak rate of the device, so as to be equal to the time needed to
+ * execute the 'largest' interactive task we benchmarked so far. By
+ * largest task, we mean the task for which each involved process has
+ * to do more I/O than for any of the other tasks we benchmarked. This
+ * reference interactive task is the start-up of LibreOffice Writer,
+ * and in this task each process/bfq_queue needs to have at most ~110K
+ * sectors transfered.
+ *
+ * This last piece of information enables BFQ to reduce the actual
+ * duration of weight-raising for at least one class of I/O-bound
+ * applications: those doing sequential or quasi-sequential I/O. An
+ * example is file copy. In fact, once started, the main I/O-bound
+ * processes of these applications usually consume the above 110K
+ * sectors in much less time than the processes of an application that
+ * is starting, because these I/O-bound processes will greedily devote
+ * almost all their CPU cycles only to their target,
+ * throughput-friendly I/O operations. This is even more true if BFQ
+ * happens to be underestimating the device peak rate, and thus
+ * overestimating the duration of weight raising. But, according to
+ * our measurements, once transferred 110K sectors, these processes
+ * have no right to be weight-raised any longer.
+ *
+ * Basing on the last consideration, BFQ ends weight-raising for a
+ * bfq_queue if the latter happens to have received an amount of
+ * service at least equal to the following constant. The constant is
+ * set to slightly more than 110K, to have a minimum safety margin.
+ *
+ * This early ending of weight-raising reduces the amount of time
+ * during which interactive false positives cause the two problems
+ * described at the beginning of these comments.

+ * If many queues belonging to the same group happen to be created

+ * queues have typically a common goal. In particular, bursts of queue
+ * creations are usually caused by services or applications that spawn
+ * many parallel threads/processes. Examples are systemd during boot,
+ * or git grep. To help these processes get their job done as soon as
+ * possible, it is usually better to not grant either weight-raising
+ * or device idling to their queues.
+ *
+ * In this comment we describe, firstly, the reasons why this fact
+ * holds, and, secondly, the next function, which implements the main
+ * steps needed to properly mark these queues so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way.
+ *
+ * The above services or applications benefit mostly from a high
+ * throughput: the quicker the requests of the activated queues are
+ * cumulatively served, the sooner the target job of these queues gets
+ * completed. As a consequence, weight-raising any of these queues,
+ * which also implies idling the device for it, is almost always
+ * counterproductive. In most cases it just lowers throughput.
+ *
+ * On the other hand, a burst of queue creations may be caused also by
+ * the start of an application that does not consist of a lot of
+ * parallel I/O-bound threads. In fact, with a complex application,
+ * several short processes may need to be executed to start-up the
+ * application. In this respect, to start an application as quickly as
+ * possible, the best thing to do is in any case to privilege the I/O
+ * related to the application with respect to all other
+ * I/O. Therefore, the best strategy to start as quickly as possible
+ * an application that causes a burst of queue creations is to
+ * weight-raise all the queues created during the burst. This is the
+ * exact opposite of the best strategy for the other type of bursts.
+ *
+ * In the end, to take the best action for each of the two cases, the
+ * two types of bursts need to be distinguished. Fortunately, this
+ * seems relatively easy, by looking at the sizes of the bursts. In
+ * particular, we found a threshold such that only bursts with a
+ * larger size than that threshold are apparently caused by
+ * services or commands such as systemd or git grep. For brevity,
+ * hereafter we call just 'large' these bursts. BFQ *does not*
+ * weight-raise queues whose creation occurs in a large burst. In
+ * addition, for each of these queues BFQ performs or does not perform
+ * idling depending on which choice boosts the throughput more. The
+ * exact choice depends on the device and request pattern at
+ * hand.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, false positives may occur while an interactive task
+ * is starting (e.g., an application is being started). The
+ * consequence is that the queues associated with the task do not
+ * enjoy weight raising as expected. Fortunately these false positives
+ * are very rare. They typically occur if some service happens to
+ * start doing I/O exactly when the interactive task starts.
+ *
+ * Turning back to the next function, it implements all the steps
+ * needed to detect the occurrence of a large burst and to properly
+ * mark all the queues belonging to it (so that they can then be
+ * treated in a different way). This goal is achieved by maintaining a
+ * "burst list" that holds, temporarily, the queues that belong to the
+ * burst in progress. The list is then used to mark these queues as
+ * belonging to a large burst if the burst does become large. The main
+ * steps are the following.
+ *
+ * . when the very first queue is created, the queue is inserted into the
+ *   list (as it could be the first queue in a possible burst)
+ *
+ * . if the current burst has not yet become large, and a queue Q that does
+ *   not yet belong to the burst is activated shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a new queue entered the burst list, then the function appends
+ *   Q to the burst list
+ *
+ * . if, as a consequence of the previous step, the burst size reaches
+ *   the large-burst threshold, then
+ *
+ *     . all the queues in the burst list are marked as belonging to a
+ *       large burst
+ *
+ *     . the burst list is deleted; in fact, the burst list already served
+ *       its purpose (keeping temporarily track of the queues in a burst,
+ *       so as to be able to mark them as belonging to a large burst in the
+ *       previous sub-step), and now is not needed any more
+ *
+ *     . the device enters a large-burst mode
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created while
+ *   the device is in large-burst mode and shortly after the last time
+ *   at which a queue either entered the burst list or was marked as
+ *   belonging to the current large burst, then Q is immediately marked
+ *   as belonging to a large burst.
+ *
+ * . if a queue Q that does not belong to the burst is created a while
+ *   later, i.e., not shortly after, than the last time at which a queue
+ *   either entered the burst list or was marked as belonging to the
+ *   current large burst, then the current burst is deemed as finished and:
+ *
+ *        . the large-burst mode is reset if set
+ *
+ *        . the burst list is emptied
+ *
+ *        . Q is inserted in the burst list, as Q may be the first queue
+ *          in a possible new burst (then the burst list contains just Q

+/*
+ * The next function, invoked after the input queue bfqq switches from
+ * idle to busy, updates the budget of bfqq. The function also tells
+ * whether the in-service queue should be expired, by returning
+ * true. The purpose of expiring the in-service queue is to give bfqq
+ * the chance to possibly preempt the in-service queue, and the reason
+ * for preempting the in-service queue is to achieve one of the two
+ * goals below.
+ *
+ * 1. Guarantee to bfqq its reserved bandwidth even if bfqq has
+ * expired because it has remained idle. In particular, bfqq may have
+ * expired for one of the following two reasons:
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_NO_MORE_REQUEST bfqq did not enjoy any device idling and
+ *   did not make it to issue a new request before its last request
+ *   was served;
+ *
+ * - BFQ_BFQQ_TOO_IDLE bfqq did enjoy device idling, but did not issue
+ *   a new request before the expiration of the idling-time.
+ *
+ * Even if bfqq has expired for one of the above reasons, the process
+ * associated with the queue may be however issuing requests greedily,
+ * and thus be sensitive to the bandwidth it receives (bfqq may have
+ * remained idle for other reasons: CPU high load, bfqq not enjoying
+ * idling, I/O throttling somewhere in the path from the process to
+ * the I/O scheduler, ...). But if, after every expiration for one of
+ * the above two reasons, bfqq has to wait for the service of at least
+ * one full budget of another queue before being served again, then
+ * bfqq is likely to get a much lower bandwidth or resource time than
+ * its reserved ones. To address this issue, two countermeasures need
+ * to be taken.
+ *
+ * First, the budget and the timestamps of bfqq need to be updated in
+ * a special way on bfqq reactivation: they need to be updated as if
+ * bfqq did not remain idle and did not expire. In fact, if they are
+ * computed as if bfqq expired and remained idle until reactivation,
+ * then the process associated with bfqq is treated as if, instead of
+ * being greedy, it stopped issuing requests when bfqq remained idle,
+ * and restarts issuing requests only on this reactivation. In other
+ * words, the scheduler does not help the process recover the "service
+ * hole" between bfqq expiration and reactivation. As a consequence,
+ * the process receives a lower bandwidth than its reserved one. In
+ * contrast, to recover this hole, the budget must be updated as if
+ * bfqq was not expired at all before this reactivation, i.e., it must
+ * be set to the value of the remaining budget when bfqq was
+ * expired. Along the same line, timestamps need to be assigned the
+ * value they had the last time bfqq was selected for service, i.e.,
+ * before last expiration. Thus timestamps need to be back-shifted
+ * with respect to their normal computation (see [1] for more details
+ * on this tricky aspect).
+ *
+ * Secondly, to allow the process to recover the hole, the in-service
+ * queue must be expired too, to give bfqq the chance to preempt it
+ * immediately. In fact, if bfqq has to wait for a full budget of the
+ * in-service queue to be completed, then it may become impossible to
+ * let the process recover the hole, even if the back-shifted
+ * timestamps of bfqq are lower than those of the in-service queue. If
+ * this happens for most or all of the holes, then the process may not
+ * receive its reserved bandwidth. In this respect, it is worth noting
+ * that, being the service of outstanding requests unpreemptible, a
+ * little fraction of the holes may however be unrecoverable, thereby
+ * causing a little loss of bandwidth.
+ *
+ * The last important point is detecting whether bfqq does need this
+ * bandwidth recovery. In this respect, the next function deems the
+ * process associated with bfqq greedy, and thus allows it to recover
+ * the hole, if: 1) the process is waiting for the arrival of a new
+ * request (which implies that bfqq expired for one of the above two
+ * reasons), and 2) such a request has arrived soon. The first
+ * condition is controlled through the flag non_blocking_wait_rq,
+ * while the second through the flag arrived_in_time. If both
+ * conditions hold, then the function computes the budget in the
+ * above-described special way, and signals that the in-service queue
+ * should be expired. Timestamp back-shifting is done later in
+ * __bfq_activate_entity.
+ *
+ * 2. Reduce latency. Even if timestamps are not backshifted to let
+ * the process associated with bfqq recover a service hole, bfqq may
+ * however happen to have, after being (re)activated, a lower finish
+ * timestamp than the in-service queue.  That is, the next budget of
+ * bfqq may have to be completed before the one of the in-service
+ * queue. If this is the case, then preempting the in-service queue
+ * allows this goal to be achieved, apart from the unpreemptible,
+ * outstanding requests mentioned above.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, regardless of which of the above two goals one wants
+ * to achieve, service trees need first to be updated to know whether
+ * the in-service queue must be preempted. To have service trees
+ * correctly updated, the in-service queue must be expired and
+ * rescheduled, and bfqq must be scheduled too. This is one of the
+ * most costly operations (in future versions, the scheduling
+ * mechanism may be re-designed in such a way to make it possible to
+ * know whether preemption is needed without needing to update service
+ * trees). In addition, queue preemptions almost always cause random
+ * I/O, and thus loss of throughput. Because of these facts, the next
+ * function adopts the following simple scheme to avoid both costly
+ * operations and too frequent preemptions: it requests the expiration
+ * of the in-service queue (unconditionally) only for queues that need
+ * to recover a hole, or that either are weight-raised or deserve to
+ * be weight-raised.

+ * the real rate at which the I/O requests of each bfq_queue are
+ * served.  In fact, for an I/O scheduler like BFQ, serving a
+ * bfq_queue means just dispatching its requests during its service
+ * slot (i.e., until the budget of the queue is exhausted, or the
+ * queue remains idle, or, finally, a timeout fires). But, during the
+ * service slot of a bfq_queue, around 100 ms at most, the device may
+ * be even still processing requests of bfq_queues served in previous
+ * service slots. On the opposite end, the requests of the in-service
+ * bfq_queue may be completed after the service slot of the queue
+ * finishes.
+ *
+ * Anyway, unless more sophisticated solutions are used
+ * (where possible), the sum of the sizes of the requests dispatched
+ * during the service slot of a bfq_queue is probably the only
+ * approximation available for the service received by the bfq_queue
+ * during its service slot. And this sum is the quantity used in this

+ * To be deemed as soft real-time, an application must meet two

+ * The next function is invoked on the completion of the last request of a
+ * batch, to compute the next-start time instant, soft_rt_next_start, such
+ * that, if the next request of the application does not arrive before
+ * soft_rt_next_start, then the above requirement on the bandwidth is met.
+ *
+ * The second requirement is that the request pattern of the application is
+ * isochronous, i.e., that, after issuing a request or a batch of requests,
+ * the application stops issuing new requests until all its pending requests
+ * have been completed. After that, the application may issue a new batch,
+ * and so on.
+ * For this reason the next function is invoked to compute
+ * soft_rt_next_start only for applications that meet this requirement,
+ * whereas soft_rt_next_start is set to infinity for applications that do
+ * not.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, even a greedy (i.e., I/O-bound) application may
+ * happen to meet, occasionally or systematically, both the above
+ * bandwidth and isochrony requirements. This may happen at least in
+ * the following circumstances. First, if the CPU load is high. The
+ * application may stop issuing requests while the CPUs are busy
+ * serving other processes, then restart, then stop again for a while,
+ * and so on. The other circumstances are related to the storage
+ * device: the storage device is highly loaded or reaches a low-enough
+ * throughput with the I/O of the application (e.g., because the I/O
+ * is random and/or the device is slow). In all these cases, the
+ * I/O of the application may be simply slowed down enough to meet
+ * the bandwidth and isochrony requirements. To reduce the probability
+ * that greedy applications are deemed as soft real-time in these
+ * corner cases, a further rule is used in the computation of
+ * soft_rt_next_start: the return value of this function is forced to
+ * be higher than the maximum between the following two quantities.
+ *
+ * (a) Current time plus: (1) the maximum time for which the arrival
+ *     of a request is waited for when a sync queue becomes idle,
+ *     namely bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, and (2) a few extra jiffies. We
+ *     postpone for a moment the reason for adding a few extra
+ *     jiffies; we get back to it after next item (b).  Lower-bounding
+ *     the return value of this function with the current time plus
+ *     bfqd->bfq_slice_idle tends to filter out greedy applications,
+ *     because the latter issue their next request as soon as possible
+ *     after the last one has been completed. In contrast, a soft
+ *     real-time application spends some time processing data, after a
+ *     batch of its requests has been completed.
+ *
+ * (b) Current value of bfqq->soft_rt_next_start. As pointed out
+ *     above, greedy applications may happen to meet both the
+ *     bandwidth and isochrony requirements under heavy CPU or
+ *     storage-device load. In more detail, in these scenarios, these
+ *     applications happen, only for limited time periods, to do I/O
+ *     slowly enough to meet all the requirements described so far,
+ *     including the filtering in above item (a). These slow-speed
+ *     time intervals are usually interspersed between other time
+ *     intervals during which these applications do I/O at a very high
+ *     speed. Fortunately, exactly because of the high speed of the
+ *     I/O in the high-speed intervals, the values returned by this
+ *     function happen to be so high, near the end of any such
+ *     high-speed interval, to be likely to fall *after* the end of
+ *     the low-speed time interval that follows. These high values are
+ *     stored in bfqq->soft_rt_next_start after each invocation of
+ *     this function. As a consequence, if the last value of
+ *     bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is constantly used to lower-bound the
+ *     next value that this function may return, then, from the very
+ *     beginning of a low-speed interval, bfqq->soft_rt_next_start is
+ *     likely to be constantly kept so high that any I/O request
+ *     issued during the low-speed interval is considered as arriving
+ *     to soon for the application to be deemed as soft
+ *     real-time. Then, in the high-speed interval that follows, the
+ *     application will not be deemed as soft real-time, just because
+ *     it will do I/O at a high speed. And so on.
+ *
+ * Getting back to the filtering in item (a), in the following two
+ * cases this filtering might be easily passed by a greedy
+ * application, if the reference quantity was just
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle:
+ * 1) HZ is so low that the duration of a jiffy is comparable to or
+ *    higher than bfqd->bfq_slice_idle. This happens, e.g., on slow
+ *    devices with HZ=100. The time granularity may be so coarse
+ *    that the approximation, in jiffies, of bfqd->bfq_slice_idle
+ *    is rather lower than the exact value.
+ * 2) jiffies, instead of increasing at a constant rate, may stop increasing
+ *    for a while, then suddenly 'jump' by several units to recover the lost
+ *    increments. This seems to happen, e.g., inside virtual machines.
+ * To address this issue, in the filtering in (a) we do not use as a
+ * reference time interval just bfqd->bfq_slice_idle, but
+ * bfqd->bfq_slice_idle plus a few jiffies. In particular, we add the
+ * minimum number of jiffies for which the filter seems to be quite
+ * precise also in embedded systems and KVM/QEMU virtual machines.

+	 * weight-raised queues.
+	 *
+	 * When the request pool is saturated (e.g., in the presence

+	 * to ask for a lower number of requests from the request
+	 * pool, before the busy weight-raised queues get served
+	 * again. This often mitigates starvation problems in the

+	 * There is then a case where idling must be performed not

+	 * guarantees.
+	 *
+	 * To introduce this case, we can note that allowing the drive
+	 * to enqueue more than one request at a time, and hence
+	 * delegating de facto final scheduling decisions to the
+	 * drive's internal scheduler, entails loss of control on the
+	 * actual request service order. In particular, the critical
+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happen
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where:
+	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
+	 *      the others;
+	 * (ii) all these processes have the same I/O pattern
+	 *      (either sequential or random).
+	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend to treat
+	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
+	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
+	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
+	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
+	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
+	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
+	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
+	 * details).
+	 *
+	 * We address this issue by controlling, actually, only the
+	 * symmetry sub-condition (i), i.e., provided that
+	 * sub-condition (i) holds, idling is not performed,
+	 * regardless of whether sub-condition (ii) holds. In other
+	 * words, only if sub-condition (i) holds, then idling is
+	 * allowed, and the device tends to be prevented from queueing
+	 * many requests, possibly of several processes. The reason
+	 * for not controlling also sub-condition (ii) is that we
+	 * exploit preemption to preserve guarantees in case of
+	 * symmetric scenarios, even if (ii) does not hold, as
+	 * explained in the next two paragraphs.
+	 *
+	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
+	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
+	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
+	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
+	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
+	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
+	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
+	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
+	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
+	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
+	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
+	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
+	 * minimum of mid-term fairness. The motivation for using
+	 * preemption instead of idling is that, by not idling,
+	 * service guarantees are preserved without minimally
+	 * sacrificing throughput. In other words, both a high
+	 * throughput and its desired distribution are obtained.
+	 *
+	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
+	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
+	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
+	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
+	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
+	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
+	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
+	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
+	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
+	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
+	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
+	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
+	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
+	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
+	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
+	 * queue.
+	 *
+	 * On the other hand, device idling is performed, and thus
+	 * pure sector-domain guarantees are provided, for the
+	 * following queues, which are likely to need stronger
+	 * throughput guarantees: weight-raised queues, and queues
+	 * with a higher weight than other queues. When such queues
+	 * are active, sub-condition (i) is false, which triggers
+	 * device idling.
+	 *
+	 * According to the above considerations, the next variable is
+	 * true (only) if sub-condition (i) holds. To compute the
+	 * value of this variable, we not only use the return value of
+	 * the function bfq_symmetric_scenario(), but also check
+	 * whether bfqq is being weight-raised, because
+	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario() does not take into account also
+	 * weight-raised queues (see comments on
+	 * bfq_weights_tree_add()).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
+	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
+	 * sub-condition stops to hold, then it may become impossible
+	 * to let requests be served in the desired order until all

+ *               requests (see bfq_find_close_cooperator()).
+ *
+ * Each (device, cgroup) pair has its own bfq_group, i.e., for each cgroup
+ * there is a set of bfq_groups, each one collecting the lower-level
+ * entities belonging to the group that are acting on the same device.

+ *    o @bfqd is protected by the queue lock, RCU is used to access it
+ *      from the readers.
+ *    o All the other fields are protected by the @bfqd queue lock.
