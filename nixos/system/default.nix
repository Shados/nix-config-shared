      # first writes out the dump file in full and then reads that to write a
      # compressed version. Given it is passed the coredump from the kernel as
      # a *stream* on stdin, this is fucking *absurd*, particularly when
      # coredumps tend to be extremely compressible (100x is not uncommon!) and
      # disk writes tend to be slow.
      # As a result, its process of capturing coredumps is significnatly slower
      # and more resource-intensive (in IO and memory consumption) than it
      # otherwise needs to be, which I've seen lead to e.g. coredump collection
      # triggering OOM killer, coredump collection delaying service restarts

      # until that point. This is primarily a result of the kernel interface
      # being quite naff: really, the kernel *could* just remap the coredump
      # memory into the memory space of the coredump handler, along with the
      # process info and then immediately reap the process without blocking.
      # This would remove some unnecessary memory copying and make process
      # reaping behaviour much more consistent across both the "coredumps
      # enabled" and "coredumps disabled" cases.
